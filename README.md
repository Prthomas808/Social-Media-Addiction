## Results and Insights 📍
Students report the highest social media usage during their undergraduate years (5.0 hrs/day), with females aged 18 averaging nearly 6 hours/day, the peak among all demographics. Usage is closely tied to academic and health outcomes: students who believe social media affects their academics average 5.54 hrs/day, compared to just 3.8 hrs/day for those who do not. Heavy use also shows a clear tradeoff with sleep — students using >6 hrs/day sleep less than 6 hours/night, while light users average 8+ hours. Mental health is strongly linked to addiction levels, with low-addiction students scoring 9/10 on mental health versus 4/10 among high-addiction students. Notably, 57.9% of students surveyed fall into the “highly addicted” category (Addiction_Score ≥ 7), underscoring the widespread impact of social media on student well-being.
