# Finding Balance: How Social Media Shapes Academic and Daily Life 📲

## Executive Summary 👨‍💼
Students are spending excessive time on social media, which is linked to lower academic performance, poor sleep, and declining mental health.

Impact: Heavy users average 5.5 hrs/day, sleep less than 6 hours/night, and 58% are classified as highly addicted trends that threaten education outcomes and future workforce readiness.

Solution: By distinguishing healthy use from overuse, schools, health professionals, and employers can promote digital wellness strategies that support stronger academic results, better mental health, and long-term productivity.

## Research Objective 🔎
This analysis explores how social media use—when it becomes excessive—affects students’ academic outcomes, mental health, and productivity, while highlighting patterns that can help distinguish healthy engagement from overuse.
This matters because rising social media directly impacts education outcomes, mental well-being, and future workforce readiness. By understanding these effects, schools, health professionals, and industries can design better strategies to encourage healthier digital habits and long-term success.

## Key Questions 🔑
####  Demographics & Usage 👨👩🧑
1. What is the average daily usage by age group and gender?
2. Which academic level (High School, Undergraduate, Graduate) reports the highest average usage hours?

#### Academic Impact 📚
3. Among students who answered “Yes” to Affects Academic Performance, what is their average daily usage compared to those who answered “No”?
4. Does average daily usage negatively correlate with sleep hours per night?

#### Mental Health & Relationships 🧠
5. What is the relationship between mental health score and addiction score?
6. Do students in relationships report more conflicts over social media than singles?

#### Overall Pattern 🧩
7. Is there a trend between sleep hours per night and mental health score?
8. What percentage of students are classified as highly addicted (e.g., Addiction_Score ≥ 7)?

## Results and Insights 📍
Students report the highest social media usage during their undergraduate years (5.0 hrs/day), with females aged 18 averaging nearly 6 hours/day, the peak among all demographics. Usage is closely tied to academic and health outcomes: students who believe social media affects their academics average 5.54 hrs/day, compared to just 3.8 hrs/day for those who do not. Heavy use also shows a clear tradeoff with sleep — students using >6 hrs/day sleep less than 6 hours/night, while light users average 8+ hours. Mental health is strongly linked to addiction levels, with low-addiction students scoring 9/10 on mental health versus 4/10 among high-addiction students. Notably, 57.9% of students surveyed fall into the “highly addicted” category (Addiction_Score ≥ 7), underscoring the widespread impact of social media on student well-being.

## Business Recommendations 📈
By identifying patterns that separate healthy engagement from harmful overuse, stakeholders—including industry leaders—can:
- Develop awareness programs to promote balance.
- Encourage digital wellness practices that improve sleep and focus.
- Support long-term student success and workforce readiness through healthier digital habits.
