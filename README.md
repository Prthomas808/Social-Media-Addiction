# Social Media Addiction Analysis

## Research Objective 
###  This analysis explores how social media use—when it becomes excessive—affects students’ academic outcomes, mental health, and productivity, while highlighting patterns that can help distinguish healthy engagement from overuse.
### This matters because rising social media dependence directly impacts education outcomes, mental well-being, and future workforce readiness. By understanding these effects, schools, health professionals, and industries can design better strategies to encourage healthier digital habits and long-term success.
