# Finding Balance: How Social Media Shapes Academic and Daily Life 📲

## Executive Summary 👨‍💼
Excessive social media use among students is increasingly common, with many spending 5+ hours per day on these platforms. This overuse correlates with lower academic performance, reduced sleep, and poorer mental health, raising concerns for schools, health professionals, and future employers.

Impact:
Academic: Students who believe social media affects their studies average 5.54 hrs/day, compared to 3.8 hrs/day among unaffected peers.
Health: Heavy users sleep 2+ hours less per night and report significantly lower mental health scores.
Workforce: With 57.9% of students classified as highly addicted, long-term productivity and readiness for professional environments are at risk.

Solution:
By identifying patterns that separate healthy engagement from overuse, stakeholders can implement interventions to encourage balanced digital habits. Schools can build awareness campaigns, health professionals can integrate digital wellness into care, and industries can invest in early strategies that prepare students for sustainable success in education and the workplace.

## Research Objective 🔎
This analysis explores how social media use—when it becomes excessive—affects students’ academic outcomes, mental health, and productivity, while highlighting patterns that can help distinguish healthy engagement from overuse.
This matters because rising social media directly impacts education outcomes, mental well-being, and future workforce readiness. By understanding these effects, schools, health professionals, and industries can design better strategies to encourage healthier digital habits and long-term success.

## Results and Insights 📍
Students report the highest social media usage during their undergraduate years (5.0 hrs/day), with females aged 18 averaging nearly 6 hours/day, the peak among all demographics. Usage is closely tied to academic and health outcomes: students who believe social media affects their academics average 5.54 hrs/day, compared to just 3.8 hrs/day for those who do not. Heavy use also shows a clear tradeoff with sleep — students using >6 hrs/day sleep less than 6 hours/night, while light users average 8+ hours. Mental health is strongly linked to addiction levels, with low-addiction students scoring 9/10 on mental health versus 4/10 among high-addiction students. Notably, 57.9% of students surveyed fall into the “highly addicted” category (Addiction_Score ≥ 7), underscoring the widespread impact of social media on student well-being.
